It's a pre-war, doorman, spacious, 2 bedroom and the Murray Hill neighborhood is terrific. You should without doubt schedule a viewing ASAP. The apartment's features include views of the skyline. There's a den for extra living space. Take note that the rental is a convertible, which means there's enough room to create an extra room/privacy for someone else or for just added privacy. The apt has onsite laundry. You might never need it with New York's abundant order-in options, but the kitchen features granite countertops and hardwood floors. You'll find an electric oven. The bedroom has hardwood flooring. You should have no problem fitting a queen in the bedroom. And includes a balcony in the room. This is a great opportunity to rent in a building that's rarely available. It's worth noting there's a gym and a 24-hour doorman. To schedule an immediate showing and for any additional information please contact agent.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><p><a  website_redacted 	East 38th Street	[Doorman, Elevator, Pre-War, Laundry in Building, Hardwood Floors]	low	40.7491	6942038	-73.9789	9d32b720e26a351b951c8f78f72f2fec	[https://photos.renthop.com/2/6942038_1479a373d17b002fe0c04f031c7bc06c.jpg, https://photos.renthop.com/2/6942038_e82da1d046119ab7e05b3e1fac9d0894.jpg]	3450	108 East 38th Street

It is undergoing a gradual reinvention,with restaurants opening, scruffy buildings getting spiffed up andapartments being built on gap-toothed lots. Plans are in motion forhundreds of rental units along a stretch of the Harlem River whereJordan L. Mott, for whom the area was named, once made iron stovesand other items. The 4, 5, 6 and 2 trains all serve theneighborhood, some part time. Some commuters in the BrucknerBoulevard area take the 6 train from Third Avenue-138th Street,then transfer to either the 4 or 5 express train at 125th Street,arriving in Midtown in 20 minutes. The closest Metro-North Railroadstops are Harlem 125th Street and Yankees East 153rdStreet.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>KW150749	E 138th St	[Elevator, Laundry In Building]	high	40.8063	7111226	-73.9157	c70606c5aea7770767998a3a18b0cd16	[https://photos.renthop.com/2/7111226_975497bc6af7e9538d03ea54eb84fedd.jpg, https://photos.renthop.com/2/7111226_309447acb9b5f0aebd4ff0d461426a7d.jpg, https://photos.renthop.com/2/7111226_ba52b7b78e6395cc62a3b58de4427f6e.jpg, https://photos.renthop.com/2/7111226_0c5123dab75962c476dcbdd82cb9d65e.jpg, https://photos.renthop.com/2/7111226_3135f36d4ddfdda14d84047af3b5f276.jpg]	2195	615 E 138th St
